module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: {
          DEFAULT: "#3b82f6", // blue-500
          foreground: "#ffffff",
        },
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```


6. Start the development server:

```shellscript
npm start
```




## Usage

### Authentication

1. Open the application in your browser (default: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000))
2. You'll be presented with a login screen
3. Enter your credentials (username and password)
4. Upon successful authentication, you'll be redirected to the dashboard


### Dashboard

1. The dashboard displays a table of items with their values
2. Enter your own values in the input fields
3. The application will automatically calculate the percentage of your input relative to the existing value
4. Use the search functionality to filter items
5. Log out using the button in the top-right corner

## API Endpoints

The frontend interacts with the following API endpoints:

### Authentication

- **POST** `/login`

- Request body: `{ username, password, rememberMe }`
- Response: `{ token }`





### Data

- **GET** `/items`

- Headers: `{ Authorization: "Bearer {token}" }`
- Response: Array of items with `id` and `value` properties





## Screenshots

### Login Page

The login page features a clean, modern design with username and password fields, a "Remember me" option, and links for password recovery and sign-up.

### Dashboard

The dashboard displays a responsive table with item values and input fields for user entries. It calculates percentages in real-time and provides visual feedback through color-coded indicators.

## Backend Setup

This frontend application requires a backend server running at `http://localhost:5000` with the following endpoints:

1. `/login` - POST endpoint for authentication
2. `/items` - GET endpoint for retrieving item data


Ensure your backend is properly configured to handle these requests and provide the expected responses.
